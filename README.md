For the Front-end development - React Basics
  React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex
  UIsfrom small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. 
  
  Each COMPONENTS had a lifecycle of their own . Its lifecycle includes four stages - 
     >Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done 
            in the constructor of a Component Class.
     >Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.
     >Updating: Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted.
     >Unmounting: As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed
            from the page.

  The main advantage of using react is that it never changes the Structure of DOM , it first renders the Changes in Vitual DOM and
  then changes all the element affected by rendering in real DOM.
